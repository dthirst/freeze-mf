# freeze-mf - a simple tool for making montages of cryoEM screening images
********
usage:<br/>
* save the files you want to be in the montage in the following pattern in **one folder**:<br/>
  * `<name>_map.<ext>`,<br/>
  * `<name>_square.<ext>`,<br/>
  * `<name>_hole.<ext>`,<br/>
  * `<name>_i1.<ext>`,<br/>
  * `<name>_i2.<ext>`<br/>
* you can have as many different groups of files as you want, as long as files that belong together always start with the same name and have the same extension. the script will iterate through the folder and make a montage for each group that has at least a file whose name ends with `_map`.
* start the script by writing `python3 <path-to-script>/freeze.mf -p <path-of-files>`<br/>
* the montages will be save in the same folder with the naming pattern `<name>_montage.png`<br/>
* please mind the following **expected** behaviour:
	* if you have a map file but no square and smaller, **the montage will contain only the map**. same for square but no hole, hole but no i1/i2.<br/>
  * if you have a square and/or any other file but **no map, there will be no montage**.<br/>
* thank your local technician üçª

you can pass the following **optional** arguments to customise the output. If you don't, the default values will be used:
* `-w` or `--width` followed by the desired width of the montage in pixels. eG.: `-w 2000` for 2000px. Default: 1600px
* `-m` or `--margin` follwed by the desired margin in percent. eG.: `-m 0.03` for 3%. Default: 5%
* `-c` or `--color` followed by the desired background colour as rgb value. eG.: `-c 255 255 255` for white or `-c 0 0 0` for black. Default: black
